This game is our own version of a tower defense game where you are on a raft trying to protect your food supply from the many monsters and beasts in the Bermuda triangle. With 3 selectable characters, 9 turrets, 6 barricades, 14 enemies, and 11 bosses, the game has a large variety in playstyle. Each character has different abilities and there are different upgrade paths for the towers. You can also select the raft layout, the center piece, the barriers, and the difficulty.
