  - Stories around the world tell of a place somewhere in the ocean that uses trickery
    to never let anyone leave. These same stories tell of sea creatures, giant squids,
    and living shadows, so who's to tell if the stories are true? All that's known
    to be true is that there are places in the ocean where technology completely
    fails, and many who crash because of this are never found.
